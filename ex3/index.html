        <p> The image above is showing the number of housing units in Ames, Iowa in comparison to both the vegetation and the bodies of water of the area. I think that it is really interesting to see that are a higher number of units built close to streams and vegetation within the City of Ames. If you go take a walk around Ames, this assesment is most definietly true.

        <p> Do you think that higher denstiy of buildings along natural areas is problematic for the environment?
