            <h2> The "Ralph" <br>Case</h2>
       		
          <p>In 1830, Ralph, an African American born a slave in Virginia, was sold to Jordan J. Montgomery as a field hand and moved with him to Marion County, Missouri. In 1834, Ralph was provided a written contract where Montgomery permitted him to leave Missouri and move to the future Iowa Territory with the agreement that Ralph would pay him back $500 dollars for his hire and interest (Silag et al., 2001). However, in 1839, Montgomery sent people to Dubuque where Ralph had been mining for lead, with the intention of selling him for a profit. Ralph was taken into custody and put on a boat to Missouri, but a few of his fellow miners “sought a writ of habeas corpus on Ralph’s behalf” from a member of the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court and were able to get him off the boat and in front of a judge (Silag et al., 2001). Ultimately, the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court heard the case and on the same day ordered that “Ralph a man of color is free by operation of law” (Supreme Court Order Book, vol. A (1838-53), 6 quoted in Outside In, 63). </p>

          <p>The legislature added onto the black laws by passing law which stated that interracial marriage was prohibited. During this time, there were other constitutional restrictions placed into the black laws barring anyone from but white males to vote and fight in the militia, and excluded persons considered “negro, mulatto or Indian” from testifying “in any court or any case against a white person.”  It was also stated that slaveholders visiting the state could bring their slaves only for a short period of time.   </p>

          <p>In Des Moines, The African-American population hit its first peak with a 29% increase from 1910; 14,972 to 19,005.
