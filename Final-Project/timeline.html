            <p>Iowa Territory was incorporated into the United States. While slavery was illegal in Iowa, the territorial legislature was dominated by individuals from southern states, whose views were mirrored those devised in the South (Stone, 1990). One member stated The which prohibited African Americans from settling in the territory without filing with a county clerk “a court-attested certificate of freedom”.<a href="sources.html">(Silag, Bridgford, & Chase, 2001: 61)</a> </p>

            <p>In 1839, the legislature inherited the Territory of Michigan’s, “An Act to Regulate Blacks and Mulattoes, and to Punish the Kidnapping of Such Persons”, which as one member of the legislature described that “ ‘no black or mulatto’ would be allowed to settle in Iowa without possessing a certificate of freedom and the ability to post a five hundred dollar bond indicating that the black would not become a public charge”. The main intent of this law was to restrict the number of runaway slaves other African Americans from moving into the states. This law became what would be known as Iowa’s Black Laws and it determined the fate of any African American arriving across its borders. <a href="sources.html">(Stone, 1990)</a> </p>

            <h2> The "Ralph" <br>Case</h2>
       		
          <p>In 1830, Ralph, an African American born a slave in Virginia, was sold to Jordan J. Montgomery as a field hand and moved with him to Marion County, Missouri. In 1834, Ralph was provided a written contract where Montgomery permitted him to leave Missouri and move to the future Iowa Territory with the agreement that Ralph would pay him back $500 dollars for his hire and interest (Silag et al., 2001). However, in 1839, Montgomery sent people to Dubuque where Ralph had been mining for lead, with the intention of selling him for a profit. Ralph was taken into custody and put on a boat to Missouri, but a few of his fellow miners “sought a writ of habeas corpus on Ralph’s behalf” from a member of the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court and were able to get him off the boat and in front of a judge. Ultimately, the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court heard the case and on the same day ordered that “Ralph a man of color is free by operation of law”. <a hhref="sources.html"> (AALFDSM, 2017; Silag et al., 2001)</a> </p>

          <p>The legislature added to the State’s black laws by passing a law that prohibited interracial marriage. During this time, there were other constitutional restrictions placed into the black laws barring anyone but white males to vote or fight in the militia, and excluded persons considered “negro, mulatto or Indian” from testifying “in any court or any case against a white person”. Slaveholders visiting the state could bring their slaves only for a short period of time. <a href="sources.html"> (Dykstra, 1982; Stone, 1990)</a> </p>

          <p>Slaves who sought refuge in Iowa did not generally have a smooth transition into free land. Years before the Fugitive Slave Act came into effect, “slave owners from Missouri and Nebraska came to Iowa to reclaim slaves” and in communities in southern Iowa, such as Keokuk, locals became slave catchers who then returned runaway slaves back to their owners.  Despite this, slaves kept taking refuge in Iowa, risking their lives to be free. <a href="sources.html">(Hill, 1981)</a> </p>

          <p>In the 1850s, antislavery Iowans and abolitionists worked to reverse laws and bring more equality to Iowa. However, in 1857, the antislavery movement had not made an impact and Iowa voters rejected “a proposition to strike the word ‘white’ from the state constitutional provision regarding suffrage” as newspapers “had struck fear into the minds of many readers with editorials predicting that blacks would dominate a state with black suffrage”. While those aspects were not positive, there were other changes in the Iowa bill of rights the gave African Americans some legal status by “expanding the right for blacks to a trial by jury and the right to testify in court”.<a href="sources.html"> (Stone, 1990)</a></p>

          <p>The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) started in the south just after the civil war in 1865, as a group of whites wanted to “protect themselves and to terrorize black people”. The main purpose of organizing this group was because slaves had become freed, past slaveowners were resentful about losing power and they feared “retaliation by the newly freed blacks”. The KKK did not have much support and only lasted until about 1870. It wasn’t until World War I that the KKK began to reform and organize. <a href="sources.html">(Brigham)</a> </p>

          <p>The concept of a sundown town came into practice in the 1890s and lasted until the 1980s. These were towns that either legally or illegally told African Americans that they should not be in their town after dark or bad things would happen to them. Interestingly, this type of racism was assumed by Midwesterners to be a product of the South, however, “it was actually rare”. James Loewen, author of Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism, traveled around Iowa, and while unable to research all cities in the state, studied census numbers and used local histories to figure out if the towns could have been sundown towns. Based on his research, there are approximately 44 possible sundown towns in Iowa. One rural town, New Market, has been said to be a sundown town by locals and James Loewen when he visited Taylor County as research for his book. A Des Moines Register article from 2006, notes that “other communities, including at least two in Taylor County, had city ordinances barring blacks from the town after dark”.  New Market is said to have had a sundown ordinance in place until the 1980s and is believed that “it wasn’t until 1985 when they finally took the signs down, because it was on the books”. Iowa has always been predominately white, and it is clear that many towns in Iowa restricted the number of blacks that lived within their communities. Part of this may have been racial, but it should not be forgotten that rural Iowa was not a place for African Americans to be successful between the 1930s and 1990s. <a href="sources.html">(Kilen, 2006; Rudison, 2019)</a> </p>

The town of Buxton is a good example of how, despite discriminatory state and federal laws, a small town could provide “racial harmony and integration” with a “unique multi-ethnic community” and deliver equal wages for all miners no matter the color of their skin  (“Buxton: Iowa’s Black Utopia”). Buxton shows that while segregation was taking over the country and Jim Crow Laws were being put into effect, Buxton did not enforce those laws and beliefs. They were able to have equal access to all public accommodations and “did not have to settle for the worst living conditions or undesired residence”. <a href="sources.html">(Stone, 1990;"Buxton: Iowa's Black Utopia;Gray, 1984)</a> </p>

While the GI Bill served almost 10 million veterans by 1956, the benefits it provided were not equally distributed. While the bill itself provided benefits to all veterans, it was easier for white men to receive those benefits compared to women and African Americans. When African Americans did receive tuition money their choices were not great as “many colleges were segregated” and when looking to buy houses local banks refused to provide loans to African Americans. Similarly, “many of America’s new, suburban neighborhoods prohibited African Americans from moving in” causing African Americans to live concentrated in urban areas while whites fled to the suburbs. <a href="sources.html">(Editors, 2018)</a>   </p> <a href="https://kendyl66.github.io/LA458-558/Final-Project/history.html"> Read More</a> <br> <br>

This riot came at a time when African Americans were starting to be infused by the rhetoric of black power. <a href="sources.html">(Fehn & Jefferson, 2010)</a> </p><br>

          <h2> Fair Housing Act</h2>
          <p>When the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was enacted it worked to outlaw racially restrictive covenants and discriminatory practices by banks, lenders and realtors. However, while the law itself banned discrimination in housing these practices did not just disappear. Discriminatory practices were still used but just in a different less overt way.</p><a href="https://kendyl66.github.io/LA458-558/Final-Project/history.html"> Read More</a> <br>

          <p>The Black Panther Party emerged in Des Moines in 1968. Its leader was Mary Rem, who had left Des Moines “in 1967 just after her high school graduation” and she “headed for Oakland, California” where the headquarters of the Black Panther Party was growing. In 1968, she came back to Des Moines and along with Charles Knox, founded the Black Panther Party with the intention of promoting and developing “black power in the community” which meant “the economic, political and cultural control of the black community by black people”. The Des Moines BBP chapter understood and used the practices established by the national BBP in California, but only addressed the things that were relevant to African Americans in Des Moines. The party only lasted until 1970, but its influence on the Des Moines, both black and white, was evident. It is said that while the larger community was “uncomfortable with black power rhetoric” it was acknowledge “that the party’s programs, demonstrations, and posturing spurred the city toward more equitable employment of black citizens”. <a href="sources.html">(Fehn & Jefferson, 2010)</a>

          <h2> Iowa Hate Crimes Act</h2>
          <p>In 1988, Iowa passed the Iowa Hate Crimes Act which emphasized the need to educate and challenge people who were practicing racially motivated hate and violence. When it passed it committed anyone who participated of a felony or misdemeanor and was expanded in 1990 to expand the classes of who was protected under it (Silag et al., 2001).</p>

          <h2>Waterloo, Iowa: Worst Place for African Americans</h2>
          <p>On November 16, 2018, a USA Today article found that the metro area of Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa was the number 1 worst place for African Americans to live in the United States. The article noted that “No U.S. metro area has larger social and economic disparities along racial lines than Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa. Black metro residents earn just 46.8 percent of what white area residents earn, and are far more likely to be unemployed than white workers in the city” (Stebbins & Comen, 2018). </p>
