        <h2> Overview</h2>
<p> This research aims to address the housing history of African American people in Des Moines, including the discrimination that individuals have experienced over time.as well as, focus on individual people’s experiences they have faced with discrimination and housing over time. This research considers how federal and local policies have impacted where African Americans live. These main topics help answer the overarching question of what the lasting effects of redlining and segregation are regarding African Americans in Des Moines.<br> <br>
    
Des Moines, Iowa is a city of around 200,000 residents, the capital of Iowa, and is the center of a growing metropolitan area of over 650,000 residents. The city has the largest African American population out of the major cities in Iowa with an estimated 23,727 in 2017 (The State Data Center of Iowa, 2019).<br> <br>
    
As the capital and largest city in Iowa, the City of Des Moines, as well as its corresponding county, Polk County, have been deeply struck by racial injustice and division. When looking at the whole State, in 2010 Iowa ranked 3rd  in racial disparity in incarceration rates for black and white U.S. residents with an 11.1:1 ratio of African American prisoners to White prisoners respectively (U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2016).  Similarly, at only 3 percent of Iowa’s total population, African Americans make up 23 percent of the incarcerated population and there were approximately 3,473 African Americans per 100,000 people of the same racial group, which is the highest in the state by racial group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).  In 2017, African American Iowans reached a poverty rate of 32.3 percent compared to the state rate of 10.7 percent and the percentage of families with related children under 18 was 39.6 percent  compared to 10.9 percent of Iowa’s population (The State Data Center of Iowa, 2019).  When specifically looking at Polk County, African American residents in 2017 saw an unemployment rate of 16.7 percent compared to the “overall county unemployment rate of 3.5 percent” (One Economy, 2017:21). Likewise, African Americans made up 26 percent of the population living in the urban core while only 4 percent were represented throughout the Des Moines/West Des Moines Metro and 5 percent of the total county population (One Economy, 2017:21).  When looking at the metro area, the dissimilarity index in 2010 shows a score of 51.6 (CensusScope).  A dissimilarity index of 51.6 means that 51.6 percent of “white people would need to move to another neighborhood to make whites and blacks evenly distributed across all neighborhoods” (CensusScope).  Each of these statistics clearly show that both the State of Iowa, Polk County and Des Moines Metro allowed and continue to allow race to play a crucial role in the success and prosperity of different groups across a variety of areas. African American Iowans face countless challenges, economically and socially, that have been imbedded and designed to hinder growth and quality of life.  The City of Des Moines is quite similar to the larger, more diverse cities around the United States who have been involved in loads of research to understand the impact and legacy of race inequality and segregation on specified communities. <br> <br>
Since its establishment in 1838, the State of Iowa has been predominantly white, but being located in the middle of the country, many runaway and freed slaves from Missouri and beyond, made their way into Iowa. Iowa’s racial acceptance during the early years of its establishment was not unlike that of the southern confederate states. Particularly in the south east corner of Iowa, Iowans held the same beliefs about slavery and unequal treatment of African Americans. before the Civil War ended in 1865, even though they were part of the Union. These sediments are evidenced by multiple laws and social codes put in place when Iowa became a territory. In 1838 Iowa inherited the Territory of Michigan’s “An Act to Regulate Blacks and Mulattoes, and to Punish the Kidnapping of Such Persons” which prohibited African Americans from settling in the territory without filing with a county clerk “a court-attested certificate of freedom” (Silag, Bridgford, & Chase, 2001: 61). In 1844, Iowa delegates drafted a Constitution that was sent with “a petition for statehood to the United States Congress” (Silag et al., 2001: 65). Within this document African Americans were barred from immigration into the state as a way to ensure that blacks would not overrun the new state. These types of laws were prominent between Iowa’s Statehood in 1846 and end of the Civil War in the late 1860s. The State of Iowa, for a large portion of its initial settlement years, created an environment that was not welcoming to African Americans. Even when slavery was abolished and new laws were written to alleviate some discrimination, Iowa society still held on to its discriminatory ways. <br> <br>

Federal laws, particularly the creation of the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in 1933 and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in 1934, impacted African American communities dramatically forcing them to live in neglected areas. These organizations viewed these areas as too risky for banks and lenders to provide loans for homeownership. To ensure racial division, HOLC created maps “that coded areas as creditworthy based on the race of their occupants and the age of the housing stock” (Denton, 2006). These maps adopted by the FHA in 1934, prevented black residents from obtaining long-term mortgages for the purchase of a home and the maps operated alongside other practices including “restrictive covenants, violence and blockbusting” to create neighborhoods that ended up as ghettos (Denton, 2006). The influence of these maps and the outcome of their impact on neighborhoods created the common phrase; redlining maps. The redlining map of Des Moines allowed lenders and banks to ensure certain neighborhoods stayed white and maintained, while other specified areas retained and sustained minority residents and deteriorating structures. Redlining caused a lasting impact on where African Americans live today and the quality of their neighborhoods and communities.<br> <br>

Census data from 1920, 1940, 1970, 2000, and 2010, reveals a trend on where African Americans have been located in the City of Des Moines over the decades. And the comparison of these maps to the HOLC map of 1936, makes it even more clear about what is being seen in the trend across years and how distinct neighborhoods with concentrations of African Americans came to fruition. While it appears the distribution of African Americans is spreading across the city, which can partially be explained by the increased number of African Americans living in Des Moines, the areas of high concentration have not changed dramatically. Redlining has left not only an influence on where African Americans have lived over time, but it has had a significant impact on the built environment itself. The areas of higher risk and minority concentrate have not experienced investment or infrastructure improvements like other parts of city.  The City of Des Moines forced these neighborhoods to go without state and federal money to improve the quality of homes, roads and other amenities for an enriched quality of life.  There are even areas we see today where once predominantly African American and minority neighborhoods scattered with low-income housing are being bought, sold and developed upon by companies who desire profit over emphasizing exchange value of housing over the use value. These changes are creating different areas of higher concentrations of low-income and minority communities. <br><br>
    
While on the surface it appears that many of the laws produced by the State of Iowa and the federal government attempted to address issues of civil rights and discrimination throughout employment and housing, much of the underlying and lasting effects of systematic racism has left its mark on the physical landscape and on the communities disregarded and destroyed over time. When looking forward, it is crucial for planners, city officials and other organizations to take this context into consideration when implementing new laws and proposing new developments. There has been a problem in Des Moines and in the larger metropolitan region of having discussions of affordability in housing and inclusivity of communities, however not much action has taken place. Everyone is talking the talk, but not walking the walk. The legacy of segregation and redlining in Des Moines is a serious and pertinent problem that must be acted upon now.  (add)
It must also be considered why some areas are seeing more African American households than others and what are the influences that are causing them to shift. Similarly, another question must be posed, what is happening in the suburban areas that might be drawing more white residents to the higher end suburbs leaving more options available for African Americans in the City limits. These questions cannot fully be answered in this research, but should be researched more at length to see, at the present day, what is happening with this population and why. Addressing this larger issue could help planners and officials make better decisions on what to do moving forward.
