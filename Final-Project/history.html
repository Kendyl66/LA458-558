  <h1>Housing Policy History</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Residential Segregation </h2>
  <br>
        <p> The separation of different groups has been a part of United States society from the beginning. For racial groups, such as African Americans, residential segregation has primarily been imposed on them depriving them of their freedom “- a deprivation especially onerous when its basis is the unalterable fact of race or ancestry”(McEntire, 1960: 88).  Residential segregation has always been a central theme in the discussion of urban housing and quality of life for minorities, and in discussions around fair housing, a variety of researchers have spent most of their efforts analyzing cities who are known to have overt racial tensions, segregation, violence and criminal activity associated with minority populations. These cities primarily include Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta, which are major urban hubs with large minority populations (Rothstein, 2017b). The Midwest at large, particularly Iowa, have historically been overlooked in these studies and while that trend continues today in general, some research groups have emerged discussing these issues in places like Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota.<br> <br>
        There are generally two main concepts when discussing the causes of persistent residential segregation; racism and failure of public policy. Racism is the most significant player in the segregation of minority groups and has allowed society to enforce resistance to racial integration that has arisen from community racial preferences. Ultimately, race determines and influences how individuals interact as well as how policy is developed and enacted. While putting the blame on racism for residential segregation is valid, it must also be noted that the failure of public policy is to blame for allowing racism to control and dictate how cities and communities across the United States were developed and allowed to linger. The fact that federal, state and local governments failed to implement and enforce anti-discrimination laws and housing policies that would force communities to become more inclusive has brought us to where we are today with segregation still leaving its mark on the landscape. Another part of this legislative failure was the lack of desire to control the actions of realtors, banks and lending organizations who benefited from discriminating against African Americans and other minority groups by redlining and overtly deciding where those groups could and could not rent or buy property. The systemic racism in our country and the failures at all levels has created an environment that is becoming harder and harder to change. 
</p>
              <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Federal Housing Policy</h2>
  <br>
        <p> In 1933, the Federal Government launched a program called the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) which was tasked with providing funds “for refinancing urban mortgages in danger of default and grant[ing] lower-interest loans for former owners who had lost their homes through foreclosure to enable them to regain their properties” (Massey & Denton, 1993: 51). The HOLC, however, took their program to a new level establishing the discriminatory practice known as redlining which was developed to evaluate risks related to loans made to specific neighborhoods that were predominantly populated by African Americans, as well as other minorities (Massey & Denton, 1993: 51). The general concept of redlining was to use a four category, color-coding system to access which areas should receive good loans for mortgages and which should not be granted good loans or loans at all. As it is well known and evident, HOLC was not the creator of the racial standards in real estate, but it was the first program to bureaucratize them and apply them at a large scale. them and applied (Massey & Denton, 1993: 52). This allowed systemic segregation and discrimination to be supported and given power by the federal government. Redlining was an overt racist practice that not only was supported by the federal government but by the majority of the American population. <br><br>
        
        While this was developed at the federal level, private banks during the 1930s and 1940s heavily depend on HOLC maps, along with their company’s own residential security maps, to make their own loan decisions in their communities. Redlining maps allowed banks to legally channel funding and development away from African American neighborhoods based on risk, ultimately causing these areas to be dilapidated and forgotten. White residents did not want those considered “other” living in or near their neighborhoods, so with the development of this new tool to discriminate, residents both secretly and openly supported the separation of racial groups.<br>
            <img src="red.png" alt="HOLC Map Des Moines" height="600" width="800" id="lt"><br><br>
        
        The next year, the federal government passed a new law called the National Housing Act of 1934, which was passed to “relieve unemployment and stimulate the release of private credit in the hands of the banks and lending institutions for home repairs and construction” (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). This law also created the Federal Housing Administration, commonly known as the FHA, which became the main agency to handle mortgage insurance. While these housing laws were very successful in a larger context after the Great Depression, they did not produce positive outcomes for minorities who were among the worst affected by the economic failures. The time between the Great Depression and World War II saw massive amounts of housing development as construction costs and mortgages were increasingly cheaper for a large portion of the population. However, when World War II began, this type of construction was halted due to the need for defense. Although we were fighting in the war and most legislation being discussed during that time was war related, in 1944 the Veteran’s Administration “home loan program” was authorized ensuring “millions of single-family and mobile home loans” (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). This program impacted the housing market and would allow for major growth outside of cities. <br>
<br>
        The FHA was essential in the changing in the housing finance system in the United States making it much easier for people to have access to homeownership, which increasingly became much less expensive during the 1940s than renting (Schwartz, 2015:73). Ultimately, the FHA was essential in reviving the housing industry during and after the Great Depression as well as during the post-war period. In order to lift communities up and improve the physical environment, the FHA “developed strict standards” to look at neighborhoods with the right kind of properties they were willing to help fund through mortgages (Schwartz, 2015: 73). As part of these standards there were a variety of specific criteria to help measure neighborhoods and decide what areas were deemed “right” or “wrong”. It turned out that these standards found the right kinds of properties were always located outside minority neighborhoods. In 1935, the FHA produced a document titled Underwriting Handbook where they adopted neighborhood evaluation criteria which bluntly stated that “incompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities” as white residents, as well as recommending that highways be “a good way to separate African American from white neighborhoods”(Gross & Rothstein, 2017). This document also stated that “[n]atural or artificially established barriers [would] prove effective in protecting a neighborhood and the locations within it from adverse influences,… include[ing] prevention of the infiltration of…lower class occupancy, and inharmonious racial groups” (Rothstein, 2017). The FHA was not trying to hide the racial undertones of this document and made it explicitly clear that race mattered in their decision to provide financial assistance and, more generally, where they wanted different people to live. The agency did not invent redlining and racial discrimination in our country, but it decided to go along with already established real estate practices even though the agency was in a good position to “reform these practices, with mortgage insurance providing powerful leverage”. As fair housing advocate Charles Abrams wrote, “ from its inception FHA set itself up as the protector of the all-white neighborhood, It set its agents into the field to keep negroes and other minorities from buying houses in white neighborhoods” (Schwartz, 2015: 75). The FHA allowed segregation and discrimination to embed itself even more into our society and into public policy.
        <br><br>
        
        The impressive revival of the housing industry during the 1930s and 1940s was connected with a variety of other factors which impacted where individuals could and could not live, including low cost of purchasing homes, the ability to get loans, the rise in racial fear, and the justification by the FHA for its racial policies. In particular, the FHA promoted “white flight” by causing fear among white residents that their property values would decrease if African Americans moved into their neighborhoods (Rothstein, 2017b). White flight became a nationwide exodus of white families moving from urban areas, which were predominantly populated by minorities, to homogenous suburban living. This movement continued to over many years and in 1945 a new bill was passed that made the separation even more permanent and pervasive.  This bill was the GI Bill which implemented the Veterans Administration which provide benefits “to veterans from World War II” that provided opportunities for them and their families to improve economically and socially through housing loans and medical benefits (Gross & Rothstein, 2017; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, n.d.).  While this benefited a large portion of the veteran population, African American veterans were excluded from these benefits and could not get loans for housing. The GI Bill, while not its intention to be housing policy, strictly excluded African Americans from obtaining housing outside of the urban core and ultimately played a crucial role in the segregation of African Americans across the United States. Richard Rothstein, author of Color of Law, notes that the Veteran’s Administration “adopted all of the FHA racial exclusion programs” and together these programs made it so African Americans were “not permitted to move into areas that the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration had designated for whites”(Gross & Rothstein, 2017). <br>
            <img  src="gi.jpg" alt="Passing of GI Bill" height="350" width="600" float="right" id="lt"><br><br>
	   
        After World War II, there was a movement of white families to the suburbs, known as white flight. Between 1947 and 1956 the federal government developed programs and laws that would increase construction of housing, improve urban centers, and generate public housing. In 1949, the federal government enacted another Housing Act, which authorized “funds to localities to assist in slum clearance and urban development, new construction” and other infrastructure items including vacant land, open assets, facilities, sewer facilities and water facilities (Gross & Rothstein, 2017). With white flight in cities across the United States, the Act’s major funding pushes for slum clearance and development specifically was a direct attack on the minority populations within the area and the low-income working men and women who were unable to move to the suburbs. The government, both federal and local, were able to decide which areas were considered slums and make the decision where new development would be most impactful, and generally those areas deemed unwanted or ghettos were areas with higher concentrations of African Americans and other minorities, including the poor working class. While the 1949 Act provided new construction opportunities for cities in blighted areas, the amendment in 1954 brought the term “urban renewal” which was meant to focus more on both conservation of these blighted areas, but also larger public efforts to revitalize inner cities (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). This amendment promoted the new idea of public housing development for low-income and minority populations that ultimately forced those groups into worse conditions that before as the buildings and properties were not maintained. And again in 1956, a new amendment was passed that authorized payment to people displaced by urban renewal and in need of relocation (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). <br> 
<img src="white.jpg" alt="White Flight" height="400" width="600" id="rt"><br><br>
            
        The 1950s-60s were a time of racial dissonance. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which 1968, the United States passed the Fair Housing Act that was intended to prohibit “discrimination in housing based on a person’s race, color, religion, gender, disability, familial status, or national origin” (Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice for the State of Iowa, 2014; 1). However, despite this expressed intent, Congress ensured there would be “an unworkable enforcement mechanism” which, in practice, gave HUD limited power to help those who suffered discrimination (Lamb, 2005: 22). The Fair Housing Act processing of complaints alleging discrimination in housing was ineffective and the monitoring of cities for segregated neighborhoods was deficient. The Fair Housing Act’s weakness in enforcement caused some turmoil within Congress as many committees tried to come to a consensus about what should be done, however, the hearings were never enough to make any substantial change (Meyer, 2000: 215). The Fair Housing Act continued to segregate and discriminate against African Americans on what they claimed to be an economic basis, due their poor credit, not a racialized one. While the Fair Housing Act had good intentions on the surface, the racism imbedded in our society and specifically in the mortgage lending and real estate practices would not allow for the laws to be operated and used to their written potential. <br> 

	While the federal housing history continues until the present day, these policies discussed above were the most significant in the forming of residential segregation and the lasting effect it has had on communities around the United States, including Des Moines, Iowa.

        <h2> Iowa State and Local Housing Policy</h2>
  <br>
        <p>Iowa’s housing policies and anti-discrimination laws followed similarly to those made by the federal government, however there are a few specific moments in time that need to be discussed in order to fully understand how Iowa and more specifically the City of Des Moines has viewed residential segregation and addressed the issues. <br><br>
	
        As the state was committed to white supremacy during its early years as a territory, it was stated in the 1839 Laws of the Territory in the section titled “An Act to Regulate Blacks and Mulattoes and to Punish the Kidnapping of such Persons”, that African Americans who desired to live in Iowa had to “register with the clerk’s office in each county and post a five hundred dollar bond, guaranteeing their good behavior and preventing their becoming public charges of the state” (Dykstra, 1982: 409; Hill, n.d.: 290). These were the start of Iowa’s black codes which determined the fate of any African American arriving across its borders. <br><br>

            <img  src="runaway.JPG" alt="Passing of GI Bill" height="600" width="500" float="right" id="lt"><br><br>
        Leading up to the enactment of the 1851 Exclusionary Law in Iowa, discussions surrounding black exclusion was an important topic, particularly when Iowa applied for statehood in 1846. The territorial legislator was aware that there could be consequences for excluding African Americans when trying to become a Union state. In the 1846 approved constitution, a discriminatory clause stated that Africa-Americans could not vote be members of government, were excluded from census taking and any other legislative appointment including militias. However, in 1851, the state government decided to fully exclude African Americans from settlement in Iowa, being judges, lawyers or attending public school. Those who already were living in Iowa were not forced to leave if they had been good citizens and complied with the laws of the state. This law, however, was not really enforced and in 1864 it was repealed toward the end of the Civil War ( Hill, n.d.: 292).
            
    Starting around 1958, Des Moines started a large number of Urban Renewal projects started throughout the city which impacted a large number of neighborhoods, particularly those that were predominantly African American. One such neighborhood was Sherman Hill located west of Downtown. Sherman Hill had seen disinvestment in the mid-20th century as white flight took hold and with redlining pushing residents of color to certain parts of the city, it became a “ghetto” and African American neighborhood that grew into a cultural and economic epicenter along Center Street. The area had become the black side of town to whites in the city. However, in the 1960s two large Urban renewal projects, Interstate 235 and the Oakridge Area Urban Renewal Project, displaced and destroyed substantial sections of this community. The Oakridge project destroyed many buildings determined to be “deficient” and affordable, displacing over 180 people who had nowhere to go, so in 1966 the Des Moines Area Council of Churches discussed the potential for a non-profit “housing community that could serve the needs of low-income families in Des Moines” specifically those displaced by the Oakridge Project(Sherman Hill Neighborhood Plan, 2017). <img src="oakridgeproject.jpg" alt="Oakridge Urban Renewal Project" height="400" width="500" id="rt">
            <br><br>
The Center Street area provided a variety of opportunities for the African American population, for example enjoying “music at the Billiken, 1113, and Sepia nightclubs, among several others” and the “neighborhood ‘brimmed with activity,’ wrote journalist and historian Raymond Kelso Weikal. ‘And its music flowed like flood waters’ “ (Fehn & Jefferson, 2010:56). Most of the black economic, social and cultural life was held on or near Center Street, and when the interstate was constructed, black businesses and venues were disintegrated and an area that had once “served and supported the black community” was bulldozed without second thought (Fehn & Jefferson, 2010:55). In the thick of urban renewal around 1967, those being displaced grew frustrated and upset with the city council for not providing them with good housing and a smooth relocation process. Those displaced received low appraisals for their homes and businesses and were upset that the city did not provide them enough relocation compensation to buy comparable homes somewhere else in the city (Fehn & Jefferson, 2010:60).
            
            <br><br>
In 1959, an article from the Des Moines Register notes the NAACP protested the discrimination and lofty pricing of new housing due to the displacement of African Americans because of Urban Renewal projects such as the Interstate 235. The construction of Interstate 235 would bulldoze around one-mile displacing around 400 families, many of which were African Americans (Shane, 1959) . An interviewed individual noted that the “freeway office had not kept its promise to give her another month to move to a house”, and another family saying “We were paid only $5,500 for our three-bed room house and now are forced to buy a two-bedroom house, not as good, for $9,500. When I checked with the urban renewal board officials, I found that there were racial restrictions noted in their listings” (Shane, 1959). The main problem facing African Americans was limited housing supply for their color and when they tried to find housing they had to pay more because of their race. 
            <img src="urbanrenewal.jpg" alt="I-235" height="400" width="600" id="lt">
            <br><br>
As part of Urban Renewal, the government was supposed to aid those displaced or facing displacement find housing. However, it was specified by the Council of Social Agencies that a “major obstacle in the effective operation of an urban renewal program was to find adequate housing for all displaced families within the price range which the families could afford“ (Committee, 1962: 3). It was noted that while there were 212 rental vacancies in Des Moines, only 1% were available to African Americans and if they applied for a rental property the price of said property increased drastically, for example from $65 to $80 (Committee, 1962: 3). Due to these limitations, moving anywhere with the same type of housing or better was impossible and forced African American families to live in areas with substandard housing. Along with the issues of unaffordable, adequate housing for African Americans, the Urban renewal staff did not provide communication to families being displaced resulting in many families having “moved before they could receive help from the Urban Renewal Staff because of a lack of information as to their status” (Committee, 1962: 4). Urban renewal staff needed to take responsibility to keep those families informed about when displacement would happen and the options they had to secure standard housing, however they were ignorant in dealing with the groups they were positioned to aid (Committee, 1962: 4). This lack of communication led to hundreds of families being displaced without warning and without support from the government. 
            <br><br>
In the River Hills neighborhood undergoing Interstate 235 urban renewal, the staff presented a table which showed the distribution of African Americans throughout that urban renewal area. This found that 43% of nonwhite households were in the urban renewal area and of that number, 12% of the nonwhites living there resided in houses.
            <img src="riverhills.jpg" alt="I-235" height="400" width="600" id="lt">
            <br><br>
Urban renewal disrupted and dissolved large portions of African American neighborhoods throughout Des Moines and the poor communication from Urban renewal staff, African Americans were further segregated into more dense areas than before. They were unable to find adequate housing in good neighborhoods as white realtors and residents made it impossible to move past certain boundary markers. This moment in time is described by one Des Moines black resident as their 9/11 (Fehn & Jefferson, 2010: 56).
            <br><br>
During urban renewal and the rise in public housing developments across the country, Des Moines considered at great length the development of public housing and a low-rent housing program in the city. While the public housing and subsequent program would have greatly benefited the community, in 1961 the legislature defeated the proposed bill. Again in 1963, another bill was proposed for open occupancy housing to allow all residents to live anywhere in the city, but that was also defeated despite the legislature approving a similar bill a few years earlier for urban renewal tracts (Silag et al., 2001). <img src="urbanRenewal1.jpg" alt="I-235" height="300" width="500" id="rt">There was no desire to provide sufficient housing for minorities. 
During the Civil Rights Movement, Iowa drafted a new Civil Rights Act in 1965 with two of its main sections being the creation of a civil rights commission and the development of the Discrimination in Housing Act of 1965, also known as section 216.8 of the Civil Rights Act. The law specifically notes, <br><br>
            
"It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any person, owner, or person acting for an owner, …: (a) To refuse to sell, rent, lease assign, sublease, refute to negotiate, or to otherwise make unavailable, or deny any real property or housing accommodation or part, portion, or interest therein, to any person because of the race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender, identity, religion, national origin, disability or familial status of such person." (CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, n.d.: 7-8)<br><br>
While these laws were clear about discrimination mitigation in the legal realm, just like the Fair Housing Act of 1968 would be, the true impact and enforcement of such policies were not done properly. The racism imbedded in Des Moines neighborhoods, would not allow for the laws to make any impact. In hindsight, it seems these laws were partially developed in order to fulfill a larger scheme of inclusivity that was done in theory but not in practice.
