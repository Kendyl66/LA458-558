    It has been a lifelong dream of mine to visit Scotland not only becuase of its beautiful landscape and history, but becuase I recently found out that I am over 50% English/Scottish. I am fascinated with genealogy and would love to visit a variety of places, castles and cathedrals that might have played a part in the lives of my ancestors.

    One of the places in Edinburgh that I have wanted to visit is the Royal Mile, which is the main thoroughfare of the Old Town area of the city. There are museums, gardens, churches, and stores along the 15-20 minute walk, starting at Edinburgh Castle and ending at Hollyrood Park.

    One of the most visited sites in the United Kingdom is Edinburgh Castle, which is a historic fortress which sits on top of Cstle Rock, a plug of an extinct volcano. Edinburgh Castle has a history dating back to the Iron Age (<i style="font-size: 90%">2nd Century AD</i>). The castle has been involved in many conflicts throughout Scottish history, including 26 sieges and is now claimed to be "the most besiged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world". <!-- Edinburgh Castle information from Wikipedia-->
