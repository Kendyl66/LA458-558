    Have you ever dreamed of traveling to a place that has a vast array of history? Well Scotland is definitley the place for you. Throughout the country, you can experience the complex and fascinating history of Vikings, Roman soldiers, noble clasmen, powerful monarchs, enlightened philosphers, and hearty citizens. The capital city of Edinburgh, in itself, provides almost every aspect of the country's history and the picturesque beauty of the landscape.  <!-- I got this information from this website https://www.scotland.org/about-scotland/history-timeline.-->

    It has been a lifelong dream of mine to visit Scotland not only becuase of its beautiful landscape and history, but becuase I recently found out that I am over 50% English/Scottish. I am fascinated with genealogy and would love to visit a variety of places, castles and cathedrals that might have played a part in the lives of my ancestors.

    One of the places in Edinburgh that I have wanted to visit is the Royal Mile, which is the main thoroughfare of the Old Town area of the city. There are museums, gardens, churches, and stores along the 15-20 minute walk, starting at Edinburgh Castle and ending at Hollyrood Park.

    One of the most visited sites in the United Kingdom is Edinburgh Castle. This historic fortress  sits on top of Cstle Rock, which is a plug to an extinct volcano which rose around 355 million years ago. Edinburgh Castle has a history dating back to the Iron Age (<i style="font-size: 90%">2nd Century AD</i>) and has been involved in many conflicts throughout Scottish history. It has held up against 26 sieges and is now claimed to be "the most besiged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world". <!-- Edinburgh Castle information from Wikipedia-->
